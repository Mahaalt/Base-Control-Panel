First, I made 3 pages: welcome page, arm page, and base page.

All the pages linked together and made them in on page called index.html.

I made two PHP files, one for the base of the robot called base.php, and the second for the arm called arm.php.

I changed the interface style, made it much better than before, you can check here if you want to see the interface before I change the style of it. press the link please: https://mahaalt.github.io/Arm-Control-Panel/.

Also, I made it suitable for smartphones.

The last thing is the database, I made 3 tables, one table for the robot arm motors called motor, another table for the robot status if it on or off called switch, and the last table for the direction of robot base called move.
